<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was interesting. I was able to put some of the things I've read into action and see a website out of it.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
It makes understanding HTML tags easier. It's also easier to read HTML. For example, the header tag would be for the heading of the webpage. An IMG tag would be inserting an image.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think a good job was done. The tags were indented for easier view. It's not all jumbled into one line.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The good about HTML seems to be to build the website's foundation. It builds the core of the website. The bad about HTML would probably be the styling. It's not as efficient as CSS.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I would create a closing tag after opening up a new tag.
