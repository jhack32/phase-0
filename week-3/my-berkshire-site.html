What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

It's important to link it to the correct directory. There could be some conflict when linking it to the right image/file. It's important to put href, type, and rel tags when linking as well. Linking an external file to an HTML file allows your html to be cleaner as well. It won't be mixed up with CSS code, it can just strictly be HTML code. It allows the HTML code to be the skeleton of the website.

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

It was nice to be able to refer to chrome's inspect element tool for some help on how to replicate the website. It was pretty difficult getting the site like the original. The orginal website created their links/content under a table so replicating the position was difficult. I was also able to go to the berkshire website and see what their height/widths were and try to replicate it on my clone. This helped me a lot.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

Some of the CSS we used to modify the element style were color, font-size and font-weight. We also used text-align to center the text.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you chose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

Yes. We modified our HTML with classes. It was good practice to use classes rather than IDs because it was considered good convention to use classes over ID. We originally started off with ID but changed it to classes. IDs (i think) are used when you are referring to a specific element whereas classes is used when you want to apply it to multiple things.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?

I think the code my pair and I wrote had cleaner code. We used HTML5 tags and styled through our CSS file. We linked our CSS page and created classes in our HTML file so we can make aesthetic adjustments through the stylesheet.
