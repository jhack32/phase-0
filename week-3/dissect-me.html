    <h4>What are the benefits of version control? </h4>
    <p>
       There are many benefits to version control. What version control does is keep copies of your previous changes. It records the changes you done to the file incase you ever want to go back to it. For example, if u wanted to go back to a certain version because you found that you made a mistake in your current file, version control helps with this. It allows other developers to see what the process was and your thinking. If a developer was taking over a project, they would be able to see what the development up until that point was.

    <h4>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h4>
    <p>
        Git helps keep track of changes by taking snapshot of each commit. It shows the difference between the previous snapshot and the new one. This is done only if the person had performed the correct commands and added the file along with a commit.

    <h4>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h4>
    <p>
        GitHub has a strong community where people can browse around and look at each others work. People can also provide assistance/tips. The code stored on GitHub can be accessed online so I'd be able to access my code from any computer. GitHub makes our code accessible anywhere and provides option for collaboration/help from others.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

The HTML5 tags that i've used in this challenge would be the section and main tags. These tags allow me to section my webpage. The main tag tells people viewing the source that it's the main content of the webpage. The section tag defines the content, header, footer, etc.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

Elements are laid out as the html file is being read. As it's retrieving the file, it reads it and displays it. The elements go through a flowchart where each answer to a question leads to a different tag. (http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png) I think the order the browser uses to display elements are from top to bottom. So, from the doctype or html tag until the closing html tag. the head and body are the two "child" tags of the html "father" tag.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I've learned about the snippet usage. I didn't know that if i typed html and pressed tab, it would give me an entire snippet that includes the head, body, html, and tags. Yes, i believe i will create more snippets as i continue to find more tags that i'm constantly using. I think it's interesting the shortcuts that are out there and I will definitely look more into the other shortcuts that exist.
