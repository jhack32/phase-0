          <h3 class="contenttitle">About</h3>
            <p> I was born and raised in New York City. I've always enjoyed messing around with computers and trying to create things. I went to school in New York City up until my sophmore year of college where I went to University at Buffalo for 3 years. My plan going into college, up until my last year was to get into physical therapy school. It changed after I discovered that it's possible for me to pursue a career in creating web applications. I've tried numerous free online resources and spoke to a couple people as well before deciding whether or not I really want to pursue this. I love how I'm able to create something and the feeling I get after solving a problem. It's kind of like solving a puzzle but being able to see the product afterwards.
