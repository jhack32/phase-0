How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

It was a good to see different layouts rather than just my own.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I found it to be helpful. I didn't have to worry about if it looked like how it's supposed to in my mind becasue I'll have the wireframe as a reference.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

A good, simple wireframe is what seemed to be fit for this challenge because it was for a blog.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

The <footer> was a new one we used/learned about.
