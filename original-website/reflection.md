#3.5 Your Website

## Questions

- What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I've learned a lot about padding, borders, margins. What i've pretty much got is that the margin is the outer layer. Then the border, and then the padding. I learned how to use each one (padding, borders, margin). I was able to create horizontal lines by using border rather than using the HTML tag (hr).


- What did you learn about CSS positioning?

It's important to keep in mind the percentages used previously. I've learned that using inline-blocks is helpful for small screens. While positioning elements in CSS, i was using Dev Tools and that helped a lot!

- What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I have a pretty simple design. It was very simple to implement. It's a simple boxed column in the middle that shows a logo, navigation, content and social media icons/email.

- What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?


I've realized that I used a lot of margin, padding, position to move some of my elements and place it where i wanted it to be.

### Reflection

I enjoyed adding CSS to my website. I learned a lot during the process. It was a little difficult making the website viewable on mobile/tablet devices. I was able to use the meta tag to allow browsers to zoom in on the webpage and adjust it to the correct size. I was also able to set a basic template and have it the same across all my other links. I was also able to incorporate Google Fonts on my web page as well. It was something I didn't realize i could've done.
