USER STORY
///////////////////////////////////////////////
AS A TEACHER, I WANT a program that will calculate three values based on a list of sorted test scores: the sum, the mean, and the median.
- Calculate the "sum" total of scores.
- Calculate the "mean", which is the total divided by the number of students in the class.
- Calculate the "median", which is the middle score if the class size is an odd number. In a class with an even amount of students, it is the average of the two middle scores.
*Words in "" should be the names of the functions.
PSEUDOCODE
///////////////////////////////////////////////
create function "calculate" that take a list of sorted scores
  create variable (sum) and set to 0
  create variable (median) and set to 0.
  loop through the list
    add each number to the variable
  end the loop
  create variable (mean) that will take the sum and divide it by the length of list
  if the length of sorted scores is even
    set num equal to divide the list length by 2
    set median equal to list with num index plus list with num index plus 1 divided by 2.
  else
    set num equal to the length of sorted scores divided by 2
    set median equal to list with the num index
  end the statement
end the function
