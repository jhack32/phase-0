# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I've learned more about the pomodoro technique along with setting up alarms for when to start a task. I've also learned that by having mini habits, it can help with getting towards the bigger habit. The example used was flossing, flossing one teeth after you brush your teeth and eventually flossing more teeth after a period of time. Another idea was to just to do a task and have it eventually become a habit. It's like the idea of faking it till you become it (in terms of confidence). Time Boxing is setting a time limit for a certain task. For example, the pomodoro would be an example of time boxing. You set 25 minutes to do work, and then 10 minutes to relax. You'll know when the time is up by looking at the timer/alarm. I manage my time by setting a timer/alarm. I will usually estimate how long something will take me to do and then go from there. It has been working for me. I will try some of the strategies. The mindfulness meditation, pomodoro and creating a habit, are the strategies i will definitely try to implement. My overall plan is try to finish everyday when the module is opened but if i feel like i'm not processing the information or i don't really understand the material too well, i won't move on until i do.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell allows commands to be sent to the computer to do certain tasks (make directory, delete directory, etc..). A bash is a type of unix shell/command line interpreter(CLI). I think the most challenging part of this was the pages below the pipes and redirection in the crash course.  I was able to successfully use all of the commands. I think the most important commands are: ls, mkdir, rmdir, rm, cd, touch.

pwd: Print working directory - it prints the current directory you're in.

ls: this lists the directory. It shows all the files/folders in the current directory.

mv: This moves a file.

cd: Change directory. You can change your current directory with this command.

../: this goes up a directory. used along with "cd"

touch: this creates a new empty file

mkdir: make directory

less: shows the contents in a file

rmdir: this removes a empty directory.

rm: removes a file

help: shows us a bunch of commands and usage.

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

My instructions would be to go on your account on the github page. After logging in, click the plus symbol on the top right of the page and select New Repository. To fork a repo, you need to go to the repository (repo) page you want to fork and select the fork icon that's below the plus sign you clicked to create a new repo. Once you click that, it'll ask where you want to fork it to and you'll select to whoever you want to fork it to (your own account). To clone a repo, you need to go on the repo page you want to clone and grab the clone URL, which should be on the right side of the screen, below the settings button. You copy that URL and in your terminal you type 'git clone ________' you replace the blank lines with the copied URL. We fork a repository so any changes we make will not effect the original change. This is useful because people can make changes however they want and won't effect the original copy. For example, certain features may be added that others don't like.

I did not have any struggles setting up git and GitHub. I learned how to fork, clone, and create a new repository.
