- Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

In order to create a repository on GitHub, you will need an account and be logged in. After you have logged in, you can press New Repository which should be on the right side after you've logged in. Once you have created a new repository, you should copy the HTTPS url that should be provided on the screen or on the bottom right of the screen. After you have copied the url, go to your terminal and type in (git clone URLHERE) replace the URLHERE with the url. be sure to remove the parenthesis as well. This will clone the repository to your computer.

- Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the code that was used to create the program/software can be seen and used by anyone. It also allows people to customize it if they want to.

- What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think Open Source is great. It allows people to improve the software by adding in/fixing features. Anyone can work on the issues/bugs as well if there were any. There are some Open source projects that have a strong community where they work together to make the software better. It doesn't make me feel nervous or protective at all. The copyright is not taken away and licenses help restrict certain access. It feels good to have Open Source. People can collaborate, work on issues the software has and builds a stronger community to improve it. If i were to be interested in an open source software, i'd be able to contribute by trying to add a feature or something.

- Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses help grant specific permission that people can do with the Open Source software. Licenses allow people to publish their work to the public but also limits people's usage of their work.

- What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

There were a couple of concepts that were solidified in the challenge. I didn't really know what Open Source and licenses really did. I just knew that open source software meant that the code was accessible. I learned that copyright also can't be taken away from you even if you published it online/open source. Licenses help with granting users specific permissions which i didn't know.  I didn't have any real struggles in this challenge.

- Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I have not as of yet, but might look more into it. I feel like i have a good understanding as of right now.
