#Release 1

## Answer the following questions

- What does puts do?

puts stands for "put string". It prints the output and inserts a new line. It also returns nil.

- What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole number. They're numbers without decimals. Examples would be 1,2,3,4. Float numbers on the other hand are numbers that include decimals. They could be 1.11 or something along those lines.

- What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division outputs integer numbers while float division outputs floating numbers. So if we were to do 1.0 / 1.0, the output would be 1.0. That was a float division. For someone who doesn't know anything about programming, I would explain what float and integers are (which are decimal/whole numbers respectively). When we divide integers (whole numbers), the computer will return a whole number even if we did 1 / 2. If we were to use floating numbers (decimals) we would get an output with a decimal. For example, 1 / 2 would output 0.5
