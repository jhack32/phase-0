What did you learn about the DOM?

In order to access a specific class/id, we need to specify which one by using bracket notation or something. We can't just call it and expect it to only target the one element with the id.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

The getElementById and getElementsByClassName were the very useful. We also used a loop to create DRYer code in release 5. I've learned about how to append the <template> to show up on the document through JavaScript.
